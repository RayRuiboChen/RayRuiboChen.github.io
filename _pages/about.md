I am a Ph.D. student in Computer Science at the University of Maryland, College Park, working with Prof. [Heng Huang](https://www.cs.umd.edu/~heng/). Previously, I obtained my B.S. degree at Peking University in Intelligence Science and Technology, School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science. I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Xu Sun](https://xusun.org/) during my undergraduate study.


My research interests are about multimodal learning, natural language processing, large language models and their securities.
